Neural Computing Seminar
========================
This is my contribution to the "Neural Computing" Seminar,
held at Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin, in the winter semester 2012/2013.

The topic I chose for my talk was:
"Self-Replicating and self-healing hardware - The embryonics approach".
Slides can be found under "talk", my summary paper under "write-up".
